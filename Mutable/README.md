# Mutable

#### This package contains a mutable string implementation.

Basically, it allows direct modification of the object, which makes manipulation much faster.

It exposes a signature very similar to the System.String It should be possible to drop in with minimal changes.

Version 1.0 - Not quite complete or tested yet.

Preliminary performance testing indicates +- 300% improvement when searching and manipulating

Not thread safe
